INF443-Project
==============

This is the final project for my university's course on Graphics Programming.

Building
--------

Ensure you have the development versions of GLFW and Assimp installed! After that, you can build it as a CMake project. There's no install target.

Running
-------

**Warning:** make sure you run the executable on the root folder of the repository (i.e. the parent directory to *resources*), otherwise the executable cannot find the shaders and models required for it to work.

License
-------

No modification or use is permitted without authorization. After the project is submitted, it will be republished under the MIT License.
